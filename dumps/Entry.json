Yesterday Mother cooked some soup for the first time, but she went downstairs to talk and forgot all about it! The beans were burnt black, and we couldn't get them out of the pot!

What will happen to us if the British invade Holland.

We'll swim underwater, and then nobody will see that we are Jews!' `Oh, rubbish! Can ladies swim when rats are biting their legs?' Next question: when the invasion comes, will the authorities make everybody leave Amsterdam? `We'll leave the city with all the other people.' `No, we mustn't go outside! The Germans will send everyone to die in Germany' `All right, we'll stay here. Let's ask Miep for some extra blankets. And some more food. We've got about sixty-five pounds of beans at the moment, and fifty tins of vegetables.' `What's in the stores, Mother? Tell us.' 4 * Holland is very flat, and the water is carefully controlled. Once, most of the land was naturally under water. `Ten tins of fish, forty tins of milk, three bottles of oil, four jars of butter, four jars of fruit, twenty jars of tomatoes and nine pounds of rice. That's it.' Our stores are still quite good. But we do have to feed the people in the office too. `Let's make little bags for our money that we can hide in our clothes if we have to leave here.' And so it goes on all day. That's all I hear \u2014 invasion, invasion, only invasion. I'm very calm about it. I don't care now whether I live or die.

From tomorrow, it'll be like that every day. That will be one meal less each day. It's still very hard to get vegetables. This afternoon we ate some bad cooked lettuce. Add some bad potatoes, and you have a meal fine enough for a king! I haven't had my period for more than two months, but it finally started last Sunday. Although it's a trouble and a mess, I'm glad. You can imagine we often say, `Why are there wars? Why, oh why, can't people live together peacefully?' No one can give a really good answer. Why is England making bigger and better aeroplanes and bombs, and at the same time also building new houses? Why do governments give millions each day for war, when they spend nothing on medicine or poor people? Why must people go without food, when there are mountains of food going bad in other parts of the world? Oh, why are people so crazy? It's not only governments who make war. No, the common man is guilty too! We give our governments the authority to do it. There's something in people that snakes them murder and kill. Unless all human beings change, there will still be wars. I'm often sad here, but I still see our life in the Secret Annexe as an adventure. It's dangerous but exciting. I've decided that I want to live a different kind of life, not like other girls, and that I won't be an ordinary housewife. Living here is an interesting beginning to my life, and that's why I laugh at the amusing side of it, even when it's dangerous. I'm young, and I'm strong, happy and cheerful.
